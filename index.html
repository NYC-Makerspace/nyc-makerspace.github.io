          In 1836, two inventors sent pulses of electrons through a coil of
          wires, causing a movement that clanged two pieces of metal together,
          making a distinctive noise.  By carefully choosing a sequence of
          pulses, they created a form of code by which they could communicate
          with each other.  This invention and the coding that was developed
          soon afterwards changed the world.  These are the telegraph and Morse
          code.  </p>

          <p> In this class, we will take inspiration from these inventions to
          develop electromechanical behaviors relevant to our modern lives.  We
          will create robots that communicate wirelessly, move in the world,
          and receive instruction.  Class material covers embedded programming,
          wireless communication and robotics using the ESP8266
          microcontroller, Arduino programming environment, various motors,
          electrical components and 3D printed parts.  </p>

          <p> We will teach you about the process of making physical things,
          with special focus on Design Thinking, 3D Printing and CAD modeling.
          By the end of the class, students will have created, modified a
          physical thing to address a particular problem. Our students will
          experience first hand that higher level concepts, advanced
          technologies and seemingly impossible ideas are often just an arm's
          reach away. We hope people come away from this class with the
          impression that they can create anything.  Taught by Alex Gaudio and

          <p>
          By creating a sustainable system of spaces where learning and innovation is a
          form of recreation, NYC Makerspace provides equal access to advanced
          resources and forges partnerships between institutions and local communities.
          </p>
          <p>
          We provide informal learning in the form of classes, workshops and events.  Our
          teachers are leaders of innovation and entrepreneurship from universities and
          private enterprises.
          </p>
          <p>
          We actively create a foundation for social, scientific, technological, and
          artistic innovation that originates in the local neighborhood, and we actively
          work to to enhance the professional competitiveness of local communities as
          well as train tomorrow's leaders in science, technology, arts, engineering and
          mathematics (STEAM).

          <h3>Mohamed Haroun: Co-Founder</h3>
          <span class="aboutImage"><img src="mo_profile_pic.jpg" alt="" /></span>
          <p> Mohamed co-founded NYC Makerspace with Alex, after concluding
          that second hand resources donated from institutions must be used to
          create a system of spaces. Working in Columbia University’s
          Mechanical Engineering Department, Mohamed made research instruments
          for professors using various fabrication equipment. He also taught
          the principles of CAD design, and machining, and guided students
          through their cap-stone projects. Advisor to the Columbia FSAE
          Formula 1 race-car team, and Columbia Space Initiative, he is
          incorporating student groups by integrating them into NYC Makerspace
          courses and events. Mohamed currently manages Columbia University
          Makerspace. He believes that social and economic justice goes hand in
          hand with development, environmental preservation, and education.
          Mohamed's favorite place is the Sahara,  where he conducted research
          on the effects of development on cultural heritage of new settlers in
          Egypt’s western desert. Mohamed participated in the Tahrir Square
          sit-ins of 2011.  He works on solar and piezo-electric renewable
          energy and water desalination devices; he hopes to open source soon.
          For fun Mohamed likes making star projectors, jewelry, trinkets, and
          thinking about how to equitably decentralize the world.</p>

          Alex co-founded NYC Makerspace with Mohamed after a sequence of
          events inspired him to start teaching classes on 3D printing,
          computer science and robotics at the Pelham Fritz Recreation
          Center in Harlem.  He is passionate to help people discover
          that basic research and teaching is a form of recreation of the
          mind.  Alex is a data scientist in New York City, with special
          emphasis on machine learning and distributed systems.  A maker
          at heart, he has designed and built, among other things,
          multiple FDM and SLA 3D printers, a PID controlled yogurt
          maker, adaptive bike lights, and NYC Makerspace's very own
          swipe system.  He proposed to his wife while scuba diving at
          night using 3D printed dive lights, a 3D printed fluorescent
          ring, a waterproof invisible ink message and a black light in a
          peanut butter jar filled with mineral oil.  One moment, he
          might describe to you in depth how to use a neural network to
          maximize efficiency of your hydroponic system, and the in next,
          you might find him building a network of buckets, tubes and
          water pumps to demonstrate back-propagation.  His goal is to
          spread a passion for learning and innovation to all people.</p>
